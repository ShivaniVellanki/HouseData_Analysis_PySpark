# HouseData_Analysis_PySpark
The project analyzes housing market trends using the Annual House Price Index and Zip_Zhvi_Summary_AllHomes datasets to understand price dynamics. Using Spark for data handling, it calculates yearly average HPI and examines ZIP code-specific price changes, offering insights into market behavior for informed real estate decisions.

The project revolves around analyzing housing market trends using two datasets: the Annual House Price Index (HPI) and the Zip_Zhvi_Summary_AllHomes, with the goal of understanding housing price dynamics over time. By employing Spark for data processing and visualization, the project dissects the Annual HPI to calculate average values per year, revealing the market's performance through fluctuations in housing prices. 

Similarly, the analysis extends to ZIP code-specific housing price indices, pinpointing annual changes and identifying local market volatility. The input for this project comprises detailed housing data segmented by year and ZIP code, encapsulating various housing price indices and their features. The output is a set of insights that highlight average HPI trends over years and annual price changes per ZIP code, aimed at providing a comprehensive view of the housing market's behavior, supporting market analysis, and facilitating informed decision-making in real estate investments.
